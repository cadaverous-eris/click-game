# [Click Game](https://the-realest-stu.github.io/click-game/)

Click Game is a web app written in Javascript using React 16. It is a simple memory game made up of 12 images which are randomly re-ordered every time one of the images is clicked. Clicking an image adds 1 to the current score, but clicking the same image twice will restart the game and reset the score to 0.
